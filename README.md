RUN THESE FILES IN COLAB OR THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RETRIEVE THE DATASETS AND WILL NOT WORK

These three models were created in camp (2021) by a group including me with insturctor support. 
We started off with the bag of words model (BOW) then went to the LSTM model and ended off with the BERT model. 

While the datasets were given to us I am working on creating a webscraper to feed recent data and using the sentiment output for stock picks via. an exchange API. 
These files were made to work in google colab so if they do not work on some other enviroment make sure to test it on colab first. 

WEBSCRAPING FILE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS
